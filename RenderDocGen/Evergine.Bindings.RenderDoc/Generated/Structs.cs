	/// <summary>
	/// API version changelog:
	/// 1.0.0 - initial release
	/// 1.0.1 - Bugfix: IsFrameCapturing() was returning false for captures that were triggered
	/// by keypress or TriggerCapture, instead of Start/EndFrameCapture.
	/// 1.0.2 - Refactor: Renamed eRENDERDOC_Option_DebugDeviceMode to eRENDERDOC_Option_APIValidation
	/// 1.1.0 - Add feature: TriggerMultiFrameCapture(). Backwards compatible with 1.0.x since the new
	/// function pointer is added to the end of the struct, the original layout is identical
	/// 1.1.1 - Refactor: Renamed remote access to target control (to better disambiguate from remote
	/// replay/remote server concept in replay UI)
	/// 1.1.2 - Refactor: Renamed "log file" in function names to just capture, to clarify that these
	/// are captures and not debug logging files. This is the first API version in the v1.0
	/// branch.
	/// 1.2.0 - Added feature: SetCaptureFileComments() to add comments to a capture file that will be
	/// displayed in the UI program on load.
	/// 1.3.0 - Added feature: New capture option eRENDERDOC_Option_AllowUnsupportedVendorExtensions
	/// which allows users to opt-in to allowing unsupported vendor extensions to function.
	/// Should be used at the user's own risk.
	/// Refactor: Renamed eRENDERDOC_Option_VerifyMapWrites to
	/// eRENDERDOC_Option_VerifyBufferAccess, which now also controls initialisation to
	/// 0xdddddddd of uninitialised buffer contents.
	/// 1.4.0 - Added feature: DiscardFrameCapture() to discard a frame capture in progress and stop
	/// capturing without saving anything to disk.
	/// 1.4.1 - Refactor: Renamed Shutdown to RemoveHooks to better clarify what is happening
	/// 1.4.2 - Refactor: Renamed 'draws' to 'actions' in callstack capture option.
	/// 1.5.0 - Added feature: ShowReplayUI() to request that the replay UI show itself if connected
	/// 1.6.0 - Added feature: SetCaptureTitle() which can be used to set a title for a
	/// capture made with StartFrameCapture() or EndFrameCapture()
	/// </summary>
